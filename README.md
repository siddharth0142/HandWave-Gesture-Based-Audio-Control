# HandWave-Gesture-Based-Audio-Control

### __Overview__

This project implements a wireless sound controller using hand gestures as input. By detecting hand movements, the system allows users to control the volume of a computer without using a keyboard or mouse.


### __Technologies Used__

- Python: Main programming language
- OpenCV: Image processing and real-time video capture
- MediaPipe: Hand tracking and gesture recognition
- NumPy: Efficient numerical computations
- comtypes & pycaw: Audio control libraries for adjusting system volume

### Installation
1. clone the repository
   - git clone 
3. run the scripts
